# sql-challenge

## In this challenge I took data from six csv files from a fictional company and gave an analysis on them. I engineered and modeled the data as well. I:

- Listed the employee number, last name, first name, sex, and salary of each employee.
- Listed the first name, last name, and hire date for the employees who were hired in 1986.
- Listed the manager of each department along with their department number, department name, employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listed the department number for each employee along with that employeeâ€™s employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Listed first name, last name, and sex of each employee whose first name is Hercules and whose last name begins with the letter B.
- Listed each employee in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, and first name.
- Listed each employee in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.
- Listed the frequency counts, in descending order, of all the employee last names (that is, how many employees share each last name).

## Engineering Data

- I used "Quick DBD" to help me organize and visualize my data.
- I found that I was struggling with organizing my data through sql so Quick DBD make things easier
- I think formatting could be better, such as how many characters should go in a specific data type. I tried looking through my data and that helped.
